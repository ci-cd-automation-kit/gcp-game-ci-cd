Release version: {{< release-version >}}

These pages show you how to get up and running as quickly as possible in Agones.

If you are new to Agones, start with [Overview]({{< relref "./Overview/_index.md" >}}) to get familiar with Agones'
features and services.

The [Installation]({{< relref "./Installation/_index.md" >}}) guide will take you through creating a Kubernetes
cluster and getting Agones installed.

The [Getting Started]({{< relref "./Getting Started/_index.md" >}}) section will have your 
first `GameServer` up and running, and then have you spinning up `Fleets` after that.
